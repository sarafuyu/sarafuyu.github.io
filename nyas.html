      <h2>My journey at TJA x NYAS</h2>
      <section class="about-me">
        <h3>About NYAS's TJA</h3>
        <p>
          For more than 200 years, the New York Academy of Sciences (NYAS) 
          has brought together extraordinary people working at the frontiers 
          of discovery. Among the oldest scientific organizations in the 
          United States, the Academy has become an important and widely-
          respected contributor to the international scientific community. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Each year, the New York Academy of Sciences, part of NYAS, 
          selects an international cohort of passionate high school 
          students (ages 13-17) to become part of The Junior Academy (TJA), 
          who join a dynamic global network of like-minded peers and 
          mentors. Students collaborate virtually as they compete in 
          project-based challenges focused on the United Nations 
          Sustainable Development Goals.

        <h3>Intelligent Homes & Health: Health Sync</h3>
        <p>  
          As the team leader of six individuals from Sweden, USA, the 
          Philippines, and Australia, we won this international 
          competition in the autumn of 2019. Our extensive solution 
          involved incorporating preventative health-promoting aspects, 
          as well as tracking and monitoring people's health in their 
          day-to-day lives. The prize for winning was an all-included 
          trip to the STEM Alliance Summit to present the project in the 
          summer of 2020. However, due to the pandemic, the event was 
          canceled. Nevertheless, I did not loose my spirit! Which I will 
          talk about next.

        <h3>Combating COVID-19: United in Crisis</h3>
        <p>
          For the Combating COVID-19 competition, my team and I from 
          Sweden, Turkey, and the USA worked together to develop a 
          technology-based solution to address the obstacles faced by 
          governments, healthcare providers, and economies during the 
          pandemic. Our project, United in Crisis, focused on solving 
          the strain on universal healthcare facilities while addressing 
          the increased unemployment caused by the pandemic and other 
          economic changes. We suggested utilizing AI/ML models to 
          analyze the resumes and profiles of unemployed individuals, 
          aiming to best match them with courses or programs required to 
          change careers into professions in high demand. We believe this 
          solution can help alleviate the burden on healthcare systems 
          while also addressing the needs of those negatively impacted by 
          the pandemic.
