      <h2>What is Malvina</h2>
      <p>Malvina is a network for female and non-binary students at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Malvina is a member of THS and has members from different chapters and grades.</p>
      <p>We arrange business events and social events in order to build up and strengthen the network amongst students but also to introduce our members to the work-life. We strive to host high-quality events that are inspiring for students as well as companies.</p>
      <p>The membership is free of charge. Any THS member can become a Malvina member, but if you are not a member of THS, you can still sign up for our newsletters and come to our events. Join our community today and make valuable connections!</p>
