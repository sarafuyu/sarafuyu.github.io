      <h2>My journey at KTH Royal Institute of Technology</h2>
      <section class="about-me">
        <h3>Mathematics</h3>
        <p>
          During my time studying at KTH, I had the opportunity to learn 
          various mathematical subjects that have been crucial in my 
          academic and professional development. I studied calculus, 
          including one and multi-variable calculus, and algebra. I also 
          studied numerical methods and lastly, I have studied discrete 
          mathematics, and statistics in the context of machine learning. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, my coursework at KTH has helped me develop a better 
          understanding of the fundamental principles and methods used in 
          modern mathematics which has been invaluable in helping me 
          develop my analytical and problem-solving skills. 
        </p>

      <section class="about-me">
        <h3>Computer Science</h3>
        <p>  
          Throughout my academic career, I have had the opportunity to 
          study a wide range of programming and computer science courses 
          that have been crucial in my academic and professional 
          development. I have taken courses in Python programming and 
          Java programming, which have provided me with a strong 
          foundation in object-oriented programming and the ability to 
          work with a wide range of programming languages.
        </p>
        <p>  
          In addition to programming, I have studied algorithms and data 
          structures, which have been essential in my ability to design 
          and develop efficient and scalable software solutions. My 
          studies in database technology, particularly SQL, have given me 
          a strong foundation in database design and management, as well 
          as experience working with large-scale datasets.
        </p>
        <p>  
          I also have experience in low-level programming, having studied 
          data technology and components, including C programming, 
          assembly programming, machine code, processor design, and 
          circuit logic. This knowledge has been invaluable in helping me 
          understand the inner workings of computer systems and how to 
          develop efficient software solutions that take advantage of 
          hardware capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>  
          Furthermore, I have taken a paradigm course in functional 
          programming in Haskell, syntax, and automata, and language 
          theory for parsers. This course has given me a strong 
          foundation in the theory of programming languages and the 
          ability to develop software solutions using functional 
          programming techniques.
        </p>
        <p>  
          Finally, I have experience in parallel programming, having 
          taken a course in Golang. This has provided me with experience 
          in developing concurrent and parallel software solutions that 
          take advantage of modern multi-core processors.

        <h3>Physics and Chemistry</h3>
        <p>
          During my time studying, I have had the opportunity to learn 
          various scientific subjects that have been instrumental in my 
          academic and professional development. I have studied 
          electromagnetism and wave theory, including both sound and 
          optical waves. Additionally, I have taken mechanics courses, 
          which have helped me understand the physical behavior of 
          objects and the principles that govern them.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my physics studies, I have also taken a course 
          in chemistry and sustainability. This course has given me a 
          better understanding of the chemical reactions and processes 
          that occur in the natural world, as well as how they can be 
          harnessed for sustainable development.
