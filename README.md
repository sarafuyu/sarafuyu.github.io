# My portfolio website
This personal website project is designed to showcase my skills and experiences as a developer. The website includes a homepage, an "About Me" section, a section for my current initiatives, and a "Contact Me" section where visitors can send messages.

The project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and features a clean and modern design that is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices. The website is fully responsive, ensuring that it looks great and functions well on all devices.

To install and use the project, simply download the files and open the "index.html" file in your web browser. The website can also be hosted on a web server to make it publicly accessible. Documentation on how to install and use the project will be provided as the project evolves.

Libraries and frameworks used in the project include jQuery and Bootstrap, which were used to simplify the development process and ensure a consistent design across all pages. Other methods used include responsive design techniques and SEO optimization to improve the website's visibility and usability.

Overall, this project is a valuable opportunity to showcase my skills and create an online presence for myself as a developer.
